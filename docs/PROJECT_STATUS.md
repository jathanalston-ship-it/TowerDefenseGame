# PROJECT_STATUS.md — the live state board

> Maintained at the END of every session (paired with `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` — the constitution's
> workflow step 4). This is the "where are we?" answer; `docs/GAME-STATE.md` remains the deeper
> per-system built-vs-planned index, `docs/PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` the system map.

## Completed systems (shipped + tested + documented)

Core sim (deterministic, golden-pinned) · Towers/Stars/Branches/Codex · Mastery/Adaptation ·
Heroes (slots, evolution, selection) · Hero + general Equipment (~180 items, reforge,
safeguards) · Loot (meter/queue/vault/pity/catch-up) · **Gene Card Evolution (all 12 tasks —
pillar status, `docs/GENE-AUDIT-REPORT.md`)** · Collections · Evolution HQ (Genome Cores) ·
Prestige layer 1 (Molt/Ascendant) · Campaign (world map, gates) · Infinite (AI Director) ·
Power Score (+ mandatory-coverage validation) · Currencies · Achievements · Onboarding (Combat
Tutorial, HUD Tour, Help wiki, What's New, loading tips) · Notifications · Progress Prediction ·
Save (v19, migrations, backups, dev reset) · **Engineering automation (dependency registry,
doc-sync anchors, `npm run validate`, handoff scaffolder)**.

## Systems in progress

- **UI standards + component-library pass** — CSS drift audit, tokens, shared components,
  `docs/UI-STANDARDS.md` (this session, in flight).

## Known issues

- Economy: mid/late currency sinks thin out (star sink exhausts in tens of hours) — top design
  P0 from `docs/EA-DESIGN-AUDIT.md` §4; Gene Essence sink helps (≈hour-400) but doesn't close it.
- `GENE_POWER_SCALE` and similar constants are library-size-coupled (test bands fail loudly as
  the reminder — intentional).
- Hero abilities largely one-verb; roster of 3 caps team-comp depth (content, not systems).
- Giant files: `src/core/game.ts`, `src/state/meta.ts`, `src/index.css` (ranked debt —
  `docs/ENGINEERING-AUDIT.md` §4).

## Upcoming milestones

1. **UI consistency milestone** — standards + shared components + polish (in progress).
2. **Card Ascension** — backend done; author tiers + one gameplay wire + ceremony.
3. **Content wave** — toward 10 towers / 6 heroes / 100 cards through the validators.
4. **meta.ts façade split + CI guards** (madge, ts-prune, import-direction lint).

## Future roadmap (design-corpus scale)

Milestone bosses 2–4 · prestige layers 2–6 (Speciation…) · custom challenge/training modes
(FEATURES-flagged) · real art behind the procedural fallbacks · i18n layer (string surfaces
already registered per system) · platform decision on backend (cloud saves, dailies) — see
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CONTENT-ROADMAP.md`.

## Documentation status

- **Self-enforcing:** doc ANCHORS + dead-path scan run in every `npm test`;
  `docs/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` freshness is test-pinned; staleness advisory via `npm run docs:check`.
- First-read chain: `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` → `GAME-STATE.md` → `CODEMAP.md` →
  `GAME_CONSTITUTION.md` (rules) → this board + `AI_HANDOFF.md` (live context).
- All 80+ docs reconciled as of the docs-audit + gene program; generated docs are marked as such.

## Architecture health

- 716 tests / 115 files green; golden sim byte-identical; typecheck strict; build clean.
- Zero runtime import cycles (type-only back-edges by design); near-zero dead exports.
- Registry-enforced: no orphan source files, no unresolvable system references.
- Debt ranked and bounded (`docs/ENGINEERING-AUDIT.md` §4–5); no unbounded growth surfaces known.
